Drill sergeant for training exercises. Run it like::

    ./bin/phinstructor

It will list the available training exercises. Trainings are configured using a
simple object graph, which is defined inside the ``phinstructor`` executable.

The available exercise definitions are those used inside of `You Are Your Own
Gym: The Bible of Bodyweight Exercises`__ (`German variant`__).
